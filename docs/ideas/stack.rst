Boogie introduces an opinionated selection of apps and configurations for a
more or less generic "good practices" web application. While we don't pretend
that a one-size-fits-all approach will be the best solution for everyone, we
believe that our proposed solution is good or can be easily adapted for the
majority of cases.

We assume a web application with the following broad features:

* A fully featured web site with user accounts, sessions, etc.
* It has a REST API.
* It serves at least parts of its content in the "traditional way" using
  templates or server-side rendered HTML.
* It has a build pipeline for static assets, specially CSS and Javascript.
* It will be hosted in a PaaS host at least in some part of the application
  lifecycle.
